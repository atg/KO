# KO â€” The Crash Report Reporter

KO is a small Cocoa library that scans the user's crash reports directory at startup. If it finds new crash reports, it offers to submit them to the developers' server.

### License

KO is so simple I hardly consider it copyrightable. But since people invariably ask about this sort of thing, KO is licensed under the [WTFPL](http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/).
