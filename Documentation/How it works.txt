On startup (in the background):
   Look at preferences, when did we last check?
      If we've never checked before, then
         Set the current date
         Stop.
      Otherwise
         Look in ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports

            Prompt to submit these files to the user (on the main thread)
               If the user agrees, send each crash report as a POST request to a URL defined in the source. Something like:
                  http://fileability.net/ko/submit
                     type=crash
                     app=com.chocolatapp.Chocolat
                     version=0.0.25
                     date=<timestamp>
                     blob=...
